Q: The number of cattle kept has fallen, whilst poultry has increased. Isnâ€™t this better for the environment, as cows 
are associated with higher emissions?  


A: It is possible to grow cows in carbon-zero conditions. It might even be possible, through holistic planned grazing, 
for cattle to be acting as carbon-sinks in some situations. A large amount of the carbon cost of animals is attributable 
to feed. If we are feeding cattle grains (which are produced by large tractors, fertilizers, and on deforested sites) the 
overall carbon cost of that system is high. Feed production can account for 80% of the carbon cost of production for some 
systems. If we are keeping cattle on land where they can feed themselves grass, they are essentially solar-powered. It is 
also possible to dramatically reduce the carbon produced by cattle by properly managing their diet and processing their manure. 
(Methane is a byproduct of the enteric process and not a necessary product) 

 
However, poultry systems are necessarily fed grain, there is no extrinsic possible system for commercial poultry production.  
 
In a nutshell, the production system is the problem, not the animal species. Some cattle are farmed in ecologically sustainable
ways, but no chickens are. If we want to eat meat as a society in our sustainable eco-future, ruminants are the animals we want 
with us on that journey.
