What will be the energy requirements of new chicken and pig farms proposed by Cranswick in Norfolk? 


A survey by Teagasc found that the average energy usage on-farm was 28kWh/pig produced with a range of 18kWh to 45kWh/pig produced.

The proposed new chicken farm would hold 870,000 chickens across 20 sheds, amounting to about 6.7 million a year. The proposed pig farm will have 14 units that would each house up to 1,000 pigs, amounting to 48,000 pigs being fattened for slaughter there every year.



So safe to assume 28*48000 ∴ 1344000kwh so 1344mwh.  

To produce 1344 Megawatt Hours, you will need the following:
* Approximately 670 tons of Coal
* 289240 Cubic metres of Natural Gas
* A wind turbine spinning for a month
* Over a Hydro Dam, 7.6 billion gallons of water flowing

The average home use around 2800kwh per annum. So this pig farm will use the same power as ~500 houses. 

It’s much harder to calculate the power requirements for poultry, as they are more highly variable from context to content. But a safe range is 20 to 80 kWh/1000lb/200 chickens. 

So power could range from 670000kwh to 2680000 kwh. So that’s between another 250 houses, and an additional thousand. 

In other planning applications, we’ve seen councils blindsided by the amount of power required for factory farms. The planning application materials we’ve reviewed doesn’t seem to have any provision for new power substations for these farms. The farms will expect these to be substantial, and with redundancy, as a power cut can cause overheating and the death of all animals within. 

The utility requirements for these farms must not be overlooked at the planning or environmental impact stage.
