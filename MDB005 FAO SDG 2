The hard thing about this roadmap is that it's trying to produce guidance for all countries. 
 
The FAO is keen not to come out too strongly against livestock, as livestock is an important economic contributor to the world's very poorest. From the report: "Livestock plays a vital economic role, supporting the livelihoods of approximately 1.7 billion poor people, with 70 percent of the sector's workforce comprising women." (FAO 2023) It's also an important development tool, with microgrants for productive (animal) assets ranking amongst the most cost-effective interventions for poverty graduation. Banerjee et. al. (2015)  [10.1126/science.1260799]
 
We can definitely say that it's taking an overly-instrumental view of animals. Eg see this: 
 
"Actions targeting the livestock sector should prioritize enhancing the efficiency of production, particularly among low-productivity producers. The focus should aim at reducing resource usage (land, water and energy) per unit of consumable products by implementing an array of improved livestock management practices. This increase in productivity should be achieved through carefully planned intensification methods that steer clear of adverse consequences".
 
I think that we can make the argument that animals are definitely our partners on the road to a sustainable food system, but a good life for animals must be prioritized. We already have positions on solutions outlined in the brief, e.g. "improving animal genetics" - which are probably never going to lead to better-welfare for animals. So some of the suggestions vis a vis livestock we agree with, e.g. integrated production regimes, re-forestation, and the others we'll disagree with, i.e. the ones that intensify production.
