ADHB's "Real Welfare update report" found that 72% of pigs have their tails docked.

But there's more pigs than sampled in June - because they only live for 5.5-6 months. Estimating how many pigs are both in the UK, and under which husbandry system, is quite involved. So we're simply estimating each pig in June survey has a winter production counterpart.

23.6% are RSPCA assured and 0.67% are organic, which don't allow taildocking. So adjusting for those numbers, ~5654531 pigs have tails docked anually.


NB we can't name it down to the individual number, because of confidence intervals around replacement, production, etc. So I'd report this as "around 5.5 million".

It might be hard to report clearly on this in the case of EPR, because that counts number of spaces for pigs on farms, not the heads of stock. And
Pig population levels vary quite a lot from year to year.

But you could also say with high confidence that 10 million piglets were born in 2022, of which, 72% had their tails docked. Our report finds a trend that an additional quarter million piglets per annum are raised under the worst conditions on CAFOs compared to five years ago.
 
But we'd have to be careful about that because numbers are actually down on last year, it's a wobbly line over time which trends towards intensification.
