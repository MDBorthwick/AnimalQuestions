 “Comparing these results with data from 2016 reveals a concerning trend in the growth of intensive agriculture in rural areas. 
In 2016, there were at total of 974 pig and poultry US-style mega farms in the UK compared with 1,176 in 2023 – an increase of 
20% over a seven-year period. In addition, our data shows that the UK’s largest, intensive farms that require Environmental 
Permitting Regulations (EPR) to rear pigs and poultry have increased by 12% between 2016 and 2023 across the UK.”

Our report is tracking the number of EPRs - which are a defined and centrally reported type of farm. In this regard, they 
find 12% when we find 13-14% - so these are within the margin for error of each other. It might be that we have identified 
farms that they did not. Some farms are new, and we don’t know when they drew down that data.   

It is unclear to me at this time how CIWF is defining “US-Style mega farms”. They haven’t published a methodology and haven’t (yet) responded to my 
correspondence. (As of 2024/04/22)  So the answer is - we agree on the legally defined number, and have have chosen not to make 
up our own definition of ‘mega farm’ - or else it would be any number we want it to be.
