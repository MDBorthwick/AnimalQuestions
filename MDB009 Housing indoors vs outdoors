Q: Don’t outdoor animals emit methane gasses? Isn’t confining them in a factory farm actually better for the environment? 

A: This question shows a poor understanding of faming systems. Gasses produced inside end up outdoors.  
Animals which are produced outdoors are able to feed themselves grass, which can (in a well managed system) 
eliminate the carbon costs required to produce feed, which can be as much as 80% of the carbon cost of the 
system.  It can be beneficial to cover manures, because depriving them of air this changes the chemical 
processes which produce greenhouse gases. But, again, this only helps in factory environments where the dung 
is heaped.
