The very highest levels of government agree that factory farming is responsible for a significant proportion of easily avoidable carbon emissions.

In the 2006 the UNFAO said: 
"Factory farming endangers the survival of other animals and plants, with impacts including pollution, deforestation and climate change"

The IPCC’s 2019 Special Report on Climate Change and Land use also reveals that 21-37 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the global food system.“ In the UK, >80% of all our animals are kept in high-carbon farming systems.

The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s new strategy on Climate Change 2022-2031 calls for us to “accelerate climate action”.
