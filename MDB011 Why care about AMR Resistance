Q: 


A: 
The UK-Veterinary Antibiotic Resistance Sales and Surveillance (UK-VARSS) 2022 report shows that the UK has reduced 
antibiotic sales for food-producing animals by 59% over the past eight years. This is due to decades of campaigning 
for the end of antibiotic misuse in farming. It is still important that this is brought down, the majority of antimicrobials 
which are critical for human health are interoperable and perscribed for animals. 

Already over one million people a year are dying from infections that are caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A 
government-commissioned review has forecast that 10 million people could die globally each year by 2050 because of 
antimicrobial resistance[1] and a recent study from the BMJ found that in 2022 this number already stood at 58,000 in 
England alone. [2] The emergence is new diseases is intractably linked to factory farming systems, and AMR-resistant 
bacteria threatens animalsâ€™ welfare, human health, and our national food security. 

The UK still uses 30% of its antibiotics in animal farming, often to compensate for poor hygiene, inadequate animal 
husbandry, and lack of care. These conditions are cruel, and reducing the runway for drugs which are critical for human 
health. 

In a 2022 World Animal Protection UK report which sampled watercourses downstream from factory farms, we found 
that 44% of E. coli and 66% of S. aureus bacteria isolated during testing were resistant to antibiotics. Seven 
strains of E. coli and five strains of S. aureus were found with resistance to highest-priority critically important 
antibiotics. E. coli and S. aureus are the two pathogens causing the most deaths worldwide that are associated with 
antibiotic resistance. [3]
