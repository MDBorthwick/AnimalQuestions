I'm not sure about the nerves in the needle teeth, and a quick check of the literature didn't reveal anything. I assume they have nerves like other milk teeth, 
but the pain caused by the crushing of the tooth itself isn't the main welfare issue around teeth clipping. Teeth clipping is painful, and the piglets show 'champing'  
and disturbed sleep, which are behavioral indicators of pain. It also damages teh gums, and exposes the tooth pulp cavity and gums to infection. I've seen the procedure
be botched, leaving gum damage and fractured teeth embedded in the gums, which we weren't equipped to remove. 



The literature suggests that mouth infections and absesses are more common following teeth clipping. Longer-term, the mutilation interferes with the animal's
ability to root, suckle, and take part in all its other natural behaviors. Meat pigs are killed before their adult teeth come in, so this affects their entire 
life. Here is a good study on the longer-term effects of tooth clipping:

There are better alternatives to teeth clipping. Not breeding for large litter sizes, making sure the sow is in a good enough 
condition to produce enough milk so the piglets don't have to fight over teets, giving the sow enough room to move if she is poked with teeth, etc., 
can all reduce the damage piglets do with their milk teeth. 



NB that routing teeth clipping is illegal in the UK, and can only be used as a last resort where other management methods have been ineffective. 
We would suggest that instead of mutilating animals, we should shift production to methods which are higher-welfare, and mutilation is not required.
