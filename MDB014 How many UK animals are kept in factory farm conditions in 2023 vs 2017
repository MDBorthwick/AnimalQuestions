The 139 million figure is arrived at by looking at the increase in number of EPR licensed units in each of the four UK nations. 

The UK lacks a definition of factory farm, so this definition maps onto the best available data. It only covers pigs and chickens. 

NB that each chicken slot is filled 6.1 times per year, and each pig slot is filled twice per year. So the number of animals is 
greater than the number of EPR units, which just provide the ‘slot’ for them to fill.

Pigs heads	2405612	2671728
Total	1567350602	1707010349

So the total animals contained under EPR conditions is 1.7 billion in 2023, vs 1.5 billion in 2017, with a delta of 139 million.

NB That other animals, such as cattle, are not subject to EPR regulations, so aren’t included.
